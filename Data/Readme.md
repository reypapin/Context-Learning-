Data Folder README

This folder contains four CSV files, each with a collection of domain names.
The domain names are unlabeled, but the filenames indicate the type of domains they contain. 
The data is structured for training and validation purposes, which I utilize in the notebooks.

Files

    df_dga_train.csv
        Description: Contains domain names generated by DGA (Domain Generation Algorithms) intended for training.
        Column: domain - List of domains.

    df_dga_test.csv
        Description: Contains domain names generated by DGA for testing purposes.
        Column: domain - List of domains.

    df_normal_train.csv
        Description: Contains legitimate (normal) domain names intended for training.
        Column: domain - List of domains.

    df_normal_test.csv
        Description: Contains legitimate (normal) domain names for testing purposes.
        Column: domain - List of domains.

Usage

These datasets are used to train and validate models that can distinguish between legitimate domains 
and those generated by DGAs. Each file is structured with a single column named domain, which contains 
a significant number of domains for robust model training and validation.
